% function [X_hat X_initial] = MH_BCS_SPL_Decoder(Y, Phi, subrate, ...

%
%   This function performs MH-BCS-SPL reconstruction of Y using a DDWT
%   sparsity basis. Phi gives the projection matrix. The reconstructed
%   image, of size num_rows x num_cols, is returned as
%   X_hat; the initial BCS-SPL reconstruction is returned as X_initial.
