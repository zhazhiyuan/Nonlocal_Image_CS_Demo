OVERVIEW:

  These MATLAB programs implement the Multihypothesis Block Compressed
  Sensing - Smoothed Projected Landweber (MH-BCS-SPL) algorithm as
  described in paper:
  
    C. Chen, E. W. Tramel, and J. E. Fowler, "Compressed-Sensing Recovery
    of Images and Video Using Multihypothesis Predictions," in
    Proceedings of the 45th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems,
    and Computers, Pacific Grove, CA, November 2011, pp. 1193-1198.

  Specifically, this code reproduces the experiment results of the
  paper (Table 3) using the MH-BCS-SPL and MH-MS-BCS-SPL algorithms. The code
  for these is:

    run_experiment_mhbcsspl.m
    run_experiment_mhmsbcsspl.m
  
  This code relies on BCS-SPL Version 1.4
  (http://www.ece.msstate.edu/~fowler/BCSSPL/), the Wavelet Software package
  (http://eeweb.poly.edu/iselesni/WaveletSoftware/), Pascal Getreuer's
  Wavelet CDF 9/7 package (http://www.getreuer.info/home/waveletcdf97),
  and the ssim.m function (https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~z70wang/research/ssim/).
  All will need to reside within the current MATLAB search path.

  Note that, since most of this code relies on random projections,
  the results produced may differ slightly in appearance and
  value from those of the paper.
