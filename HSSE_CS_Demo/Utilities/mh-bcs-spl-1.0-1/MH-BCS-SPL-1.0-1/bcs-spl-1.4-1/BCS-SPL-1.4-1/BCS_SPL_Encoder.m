% function y = BCS_SPL_Encoder(current_image, Phi)
% 
%   This function performs BCS projections of each block of
%   current_image. The number of columns of the projection matrix,
%   Phi, determines the size of the blocks into which current_image
%   is partitioned. The projections are returned as the columns of y.
